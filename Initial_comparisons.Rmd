```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(data.table); library(here)
```

These are some initial comparisons between the 2019 AA and CAMS tables.  Data were pulled using the `get_comland_raw_data` function from the R package `comlandr` created and maintained by the Ecosystem Dynamics and Assessment Branch (EDAB) of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC).

```{r Data Pull}
load(file = here('data-raw', 'CAMS_2019.RData'))
load(file = here('data-raw', 'AA_2019.RData'))
```
